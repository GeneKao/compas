Installation
============

The recommended way to install **COMPAS** is to use `Anaconda/conda <https://conda.io/docs/>`_::

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
    $ conda install COMPAS

But it can also be installed using `pip`::

    $ pip install COMPAS

To verify your setup, start Python from the command line and run the following:

::

    >>> import compas
    >>> import compas_rhino
    >>> import compas_blender
    >>> import compas_ghpython

Optionally, you can also install from a downloaded source folder, or directly from the GitHub repo

::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/compas-dev/compas.git


Updates
=======

**COMPAS** is still under very active development, with new versions being released
frequently. Updating your installation to the latest version is easy.

Using conda

::

    $ conda update COMPAS


Using pip

::

    $ pip install COMPAS --upgrade


Virtual environments
====================

One of the reasons to use virtual environments is to isolate dependencies, to 
be able to create a fully reproducible setup, and to be able to work with
different versions of Python and/or different versions and combinations of 
packages.

For example, if you work on a project that requires a specific version of Python or
a specific version of a package that is incompatible with the ones required by another 
project, you can use environments to make sure both projects can run side-by-side
without constantly having to update your entire development setup.

Create an environment using conda

::

    $ conda create -n my-project


Create an environment with a specific version of Python

::

    $ conda create -n my-project python=2.7


Install **COMPAS** (or other packages) for this environment

::

    $ conda install -n my-project COMPAS=0.3.0


For further instructions about managing virtual environments with conda
`see the docs <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_.
